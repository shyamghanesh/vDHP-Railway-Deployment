## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/a12642c5-7be9-4dd6-b49d-e4a9976238dd) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

## Risk Classification Backend (Python FastAPI)

Classifies vitals as low/medium/high when adding a patient.

### Run backend

Requirements: Python 3.10+

```bash
cd vDHP-POC/backend
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Alternative: Run from project root**
```bash
# From the project root directory
python run_backend.py
```

Endpoints:
- `POST /predict` — JSON body: `{ heartRate, systolic, diastolic, temperature, oxygenSat }`
- `GET /health`

### Train ML model (optional)

Place your dataset at `vDHP-POC/backend/data/vitals.csv` with columns:
`heartRate,systolic,diastolic,temperature,oxygenSat,risk` where `risk` ∈ {low, medium, high}.

```bash
cd vDHP-POC/backend
python train.py
```

This creates `model.pkl`. The API will automatically use it if present; otherwise it falls back to rule-based scoring.
